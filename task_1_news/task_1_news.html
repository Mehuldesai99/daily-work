    <h2>Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's king of comebacks looks set to to be PM again</h2>
    <img height="300" width="600" src="img_1.jpg" alt="page note found" title="news1">
    <h6>Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted five years ago is now the front-runner in Pakistan's elections</h6>
    <h3>Pakistan's former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif only returned from exile last year but is now the clear front-runner to win the 8 February election.</h3>
    <p>Few could have predicted his return to the top, despite his dominance in Pakistani politics these past three decades.
        <br> <br>
        His last term ended in him being convicted of corruption, and the time before that, he was toppled in a military coup.
        <br> <br>
        Still, he appears on the brink of making another successful comeback, a dramatic turnaround for someone who had long been viewed as an opponent to Pakistan's powerful military.
        <br> <br>
        "He's a top candidate to be the next premier not because he's wildly popular - he certainly is - but more so because he's played his cards right," says analyst Michael Kugelman, the South Asia Director at the Wilson Center think tank.
        <br> <br>
        Mr Sharif's arch-rival and former Prime Minister Imran Khan - previously backed by the military - is now the one locked up in jail, his popular party restricted across the country.</p>

        <h6>Watch: People flee fires and smoke after huge explosion</h6>
        <h3>A huge gas blast in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has killed at least two people and injured at least 222.</h3>
        <p>A lorry carrying gas exploded in Embakasi district around 23:30 (20:30 GMT), "igniting a huge ball of fire", a government spokesperson said. 
            <br> <br>
            Housing, businesses and cars were damaged with video showing a huge blaze raging close to blocks of flats. 
            <br> <br>
            Earlier, the government had said the blast happened at a gas plant. The cause is still being established. 
            <br> <br>
            Embakasi police chief Wesley Kimeto said that an adult and a child had died in the explosion, adding that the death toll may rise. 
            <br> <br>
            The fireball from the blast had "spread widely", according to Mr Mwaura, and a flying gas cylinder had hit a garments and textiles warehouse, burning it down. 
            <br> <br>
            Many of the injured are said to have inhalation injuries and they include at least 25 children, the Standard newspaper reports. 
            <br> <br>
            One of those hurt, Boniface Sifuna, described what had happened for Reuters news agency: "I got burnt by an exploding gas canister as I was trying to escape," he said. 
            <br> <br>
            "It exploded right in front of me and the impact knocked me down and the flames engulfed me. I am lucky that I was strong enough to get away." 
            <br> <br>
            "I have a business on the road that was completely destroyed."

            <img height="300" width="600" src="img_3.jpg" alt="img not found" title="news3">
            <h6>Nitish Kumar at an opposition alliance meeting in September - earlier this week, he walked out of the alliance</h6>
            <h3>In July, over two dozen Indian opposition parties formed a coalition to challenge the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Narendra Modi in the upcoming general election.</h3>
            <p>Made up of the main opposition Congress and smaller, regional parties, the coalition cleverly named itself INDIA, an acronym for a rather florid Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. 
                <br> <br>
                The alliance's success hinged on the allies' ability to stick together and agree to a strategic seat-sharing arrangement, ensuring a unified front against the BJP with a single primary candidate in each constituency. <br>
                <br> <br>
                In India's "first past the post" multiparty system where the winner takes it all, a fragmented opposition always benefits a ruling incumbent - in the 2019 general election, Mr Modi's party received 37% of the popular ballot, but mopped up a whopping 303 of the 543 seats. 
                <br> <br>
                But barely six months after its birth, India's motley opposition coalition is in disarray. The latest trigger was Nitish Kumar, a regional leader, exiting a state-level ruling coalition in the northern state of Bihar and re-joining the BJP. Mr Kumar had previously departed from a BJP-led alliance 18 months ago. Now the BJP will bank on Mr Kumar's Janata Dal (United) party to pick up a majority of the state's 40 seats.</p>

                <h6>The deaths of the two-year-old girl and one-year-old boy in Chinese city Chongqing sent shock waves in the country in 2020.</h6>
                <h3>China has executed a couple who fatally threw two children out of the window of an apartment building.</h3>
                <p>Zhang Bo - the father of the children - and Ye Chengchen were previously found guilty of killing the two-year-old girl and one-year-old boy in 2020. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Zhang had began an affair with Ye and later divorced his wife and began conspiring to kill his children. 
                    <br> <br>
                    China's Supreme Court had called the couples' motives "extremely malicious", highlighting their "cruel methods".
                    <br> <br>
                    The couple were executed in the south-western city of Chongqing on Wednesday. It is not clear how the execution was carried out, though death sentences in China are mostly carried out by lethal injection or a firing squad. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Zhang had begun an "inappropriate" relationship with Ye without informing her of his marital or parental status, but Ye continued to see him after knowing the truth, the court said. 
                    <br> <br>
                    After Zhang divorced his wife in February 2020, Ye still saw the two children as "obstacles for her to get married to Zhang and burdens for their future life together". 
                    <br> <br>
                    Ye repeatedly threatened Zhang to carry out the murders, which they conspired to stage as an accidental fall, the court heard. On 2 November 2020, Zhang threw his kids out of the window of his apartment from the 15th floor.
                    <br> <br>
                    News of their execution quickly began trending on Chinese social media site Weibo, drawing hundreds of millions of views.</p>

                    <h6>Schulte's data theft is the largest in the history of the CIA</h6>
                    <h3>A former CIA officer has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for leaking a trove of classified hacking tools to whistle-blowing platform Wikileaks.</h3>
                    <p>Joshua Schulte was also found guilty of possessing child abuse images.
                        <br> <br>
                        Prosecutors have accused him of leaking the CIA's "Vault 7" tools, which allow intelligence officers to hack smartphones and use them as listening devices.
                        <br> <br>
                        They said the leak is one of the most "brazen" in US history.
                        <br> <br>
                        Schulte, 35, shared some 8,761 documents to Wikileaks in 2017, amounting to the largest data breach in the history of the CIA, the US justice department said.
                        <br> <br>
                        He denied the allegations, but was convicted on the various counts at three separate federal trials in New York in 2020, 2022, and 2023.
                        <br> <br>
                        On Thursday, he was sentenced for charges of espionage, computer hacking, contempt of court, making false statements to the FBI and possession of child abuse images.
                        <br> <br>
                        "Joshua Schulte betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen, heinous crimes of espionage in American history," said US Attorney Damian Williams.
                        <br> <br>
                        According to evidence shared at the trial, Schulte was employed as a software developer in the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which conducts cyber espionage against terrorist organisations and foreign governments.
                        <br> <br>
                        Prosecutors said that in 2016 that he transmitted the stolen information to Wikileaks and then lied to FBI agents about his role in the leak.</p>

                        <h3>The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.</h3>
                        <p>The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.
                            <br> <br>
                            It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.
                            <br> <br>
                            The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.
                            <br> <br>
                            That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike.
                            <br> <br>
                            Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22.
                            <br> <br>
                            US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
                            <br> <br>
                            At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: "We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose."
                            <br> <br>
                            "I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable," he said, adding that there is no "set formula for doing this".
                            <br> <br>
                            "There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout," Mr Austin continued.</p>

                                Mr Trump had been seeking to use data protection laws to sue the company.

                                Mr Steele's dossier contained unsubstantiated claims of bribery and sex parties.

                                Funded by Hillary Clinton's Democrats and other political opponents of Mr Trump, the dossier was leaked to the media just before Mr Trump, a Republican, was sworn in as president.

                                In bringing the lawsuit against Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd, Mr Trump's legal team said the dossier contained claims that were inaccurate and breached his data protection rights.

                                "There are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed to trial," she wrote.
